the c code compilation works
whats sad is that the asm one would work as well but just cant find a specific header file
i just dont understand why ;-;

am way too tired for this shit

anyway compilation is as follows:

avr-gcc for the first .elf file
then avr-objcopy
then avrdude, the programmer is arduino (for the Arduino UNO)

azi@~/atmega/code $ micro blink.c
azi@~/atmega/code $ avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega328p -Wall -Os -o blink.elf blink.c
azi@~/atmega/code $ avr-objcopy -j .text -j .data -O ihex blink.elf blink.hex
azi@~/atmega/code $ avrdude -c arduino -p m328p -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 -U flash:w:blink.hex:i

OKAY DONE

so we need to make our own header file, which is very quick (we just use a preprocessor and done)
otherwise use .S files
also linker needs to begin somewhere, either main, or to have a jump first after .org
anyway, make a toolchain from avr-as, avr-ld rather then the avr-gcc, much easier

this stays
azi@~/atmega/code $ avr-objcopy -j .text -j .data -O ihex blink.elf blink.hex
azi@~/atmega/code $ avrdude -c arduino -p m328p -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 -U flash:w:blink.hex:i

good night, and im sorry, i took away all your sleep, but we both know you would have dropped this today until forever
sleep well

no need to change anything:
