# ATmega coding

This repo documents coding AVR (mainly ATmega) processors, some tools I made and my notes.
I am starting from complete scratch, I gained most info from the datasheets and avr-libc and avr-gcc manuals.
The processor I am using is ATmega328P, and I am mainly focusing on writing the code in assembly as that is why I wanted to learn with these processors. I want to truly dive into the low level of these processors to understand them better.

**I am trying to make everything work right away. But there are some things I make enviroment specific. I try to document everything in notes/.**

If you are looking for a place to learn assembly coding and work with microprocessors, or work with hardware on a low level in general, I hope this repo can help with that. I went and wrote everything from scratch, only using the toolchains of avr-gcc and avra, and their definitions libraries. Everything else is written by me and with that I try to document it on the way.
Ideally, this repo will be slowly evolving as I learn more and more. I originally wanted to make a parallel processing unit made from small AVR MCU. However, I have dropped that goal for now and I wish to concetrate more on math algorithms and OS development or a simple application.

If you are looking to learning this stuff for yourself, feel free to contact me. I will be more than happy if me reading the documents for countless hours will be helpfull to someone else rather than just to my learning and curiosity.

I might not be active for a long time, but since I wish to work with processors on a low level a lot in the future, I should come back sooner or later.
